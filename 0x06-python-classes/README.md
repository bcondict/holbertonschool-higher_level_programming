# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects
#### What is OOP
Those are the acrnyms for "Objects-Oriented Programming". Is another way of organizing your program which is to combine data and functionality and wrap it inside something called an object.
#### What is a class
A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. A class creates a new type where objects are instances of the class. 
#### What is an object and an instance
Objects can store data using ordinary variables that belong to the object. Objects can also have functionality by using functions that belong to a class. 
Instance refers ti the same thing as objects
#### What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
Classes and objects are the two main aspects of object oriented programming.
Objects are intances of the class.
#### What is an attribute
Variables that belong to an object or class are referred to as *fields* and the functions that belong to a class are called *methods*. The mix between these two  can be referred to as the *attributes* of that class.
#### What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes
- Public: Variables with the public access modifiers can be accessed anywhere inside or outside the class.
- Private: The private variables can only be accessed inside the class. To create a private variable, you need to prefix double underscores with the name of the variable.
- Protected: Protected variables can be accessed within the same package. To create a protected variable, you need to prefix a single underscore with the variable name.
#### What is ```self```
Self is the additional argument for method, while traduciontal function could need nothing, method need at least ```self``` argument, and it refers to the object to created.
#### What is a method
Are the function of the class.
